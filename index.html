        Card With Longer Content
      </h2>

      <p class="card-back">
        Problematic longer content. This text is bound to escape the card, which is sized according to the title on its front face. The problem is the back face’s absolute positioning, which takes it out of flow and means we lose access to its size. This is the kind of content you get in real life: sometimes shorter than you expected, but more often than not — probably due to the work involved in writing concisely — far longer!
